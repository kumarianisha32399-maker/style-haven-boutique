    a: "Yes. Basic fitting alterations on ready-made outfits are complimentary and usually completed within 48 hours at the boutique.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long is a rental period?",
    a: "Standard rentals run for 3 days and can be extended on request, subject to availability. Extension charges are pro-rated per day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a security deposit required for rentals?",
    a: "Yes. A refundable security deposit, typically twice the rental price, is collected at pickup and returned once the outfit is returned undamaged.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if the outfit gets stained during a shoot?",
    a: "Normal wear and light makeup marks are expected and covered by us. Heavy damage or tears are deducted from the deposit at actual repair cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you deliver outside Gadhinglaj?",
    a: "Ready-made orders ship across Maharashtra in 4–6 working days. Rental outfits are pickup-only from the boutique so we can fit them for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I return a ready-made outfit?",
    a: "Unworn ready-made pieces with tags intact can be exchanged within 7 days. Rental bookings and custom fittings are non-returnable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you help with photoshoot styling?",
    a: "Absolutely. Priyanka personally styles pre-wedding, post-wedding and maternity shoots, including accessory and drape suggestions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I book an outfit in advance?",
    a: "Use the Rental Booking page or call us. We recommend booking 2–3 weeks ahead for wedding season dates.",
